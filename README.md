# Pokedex API App completed with Javascript \(With an Assist From Bootstrap\)
## Programmed by Benjamin Greenberg
Mini Project for Coding Temple

___
## Project Overview
This project is built to demonstrate how async Javascript functions can allow users to easily pull data from the [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/), which can then be presented in a more user friendly format due to some simple Bootstrap formatting. This website includes a stylized home page and a responsive nav bar on all three of my pages. In addition to the homepage I have a search feature which allows users to input either a Pokemon's name or Pokedex number which then uses event listeners linked to the submit button to retrieve that Pokemon's basic information using a JSON Get call. Furthermore I built a more in depth details page dedicated to my personal favorite Pokemon -- Squirtle.

## Special Thanks
As always I'm grateful to the staff at Coding Temple for their continued development in my progression as a programmer and software developer. I'm especially grateful for the mentorship provided by my programming coaches Sarah Stodder and Travis Peck. I also would like to express gratitude to Daniel Erazo who's assistance during an earlier Coding Temple homework assignment allowed me to better understand async functions, event listeners, and using Javascript to work with APIs.
